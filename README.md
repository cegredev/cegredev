## the history of the entire me, i guess

1. 🎮 Started programming in 2017 by making small games using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and in particular [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2pp2dCuJns)
   - Later made some games with pure Java+Swing and also Unity 
2. 🖥 Started developing applications with JavaFX (there was a barely functional video editor, for example)
3. 🐍 Created small scripts and desktop applications for individual clients using mostly Python and Java
4. 🌐 Got into web development with NodeJS, TypeScript and React
5. 👨‍🎓 Now a CS student at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and member of [the student council](https://oh14.de/fsr), as well as a [freelance web developer](https://cedricgreiten.com)

Currently only contributing small things here and there to the things I use. Still, maybe someday I'll start doing more open source.
